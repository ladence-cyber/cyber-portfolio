# cyber-portfolio 
A fortnight ago, I embarked on a journey into the world of cybersecurity through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate specialization on Coursera. In that time, I have learned: 
- What the foundations of cybersecurity are;
- How the 8 CISSP domains maintain an organization’s security posture;
- The CIA Triad as a security framework;
- The NIST-CSF (a US-based voluntary) framework;
- How to use SIEM tools (including Splunk, Chronicle) to monitor security threats;
- Using a playbook in response to a security incident.
  
It has been a wholesome process of taking baby steps towards my final goal of being a security analyst. And while it can sometimes be overwhelming combining online studies with many of life’s events, the concept of privacy and how it affects our daily lives gets my heart racing to move on to the next module. I have since completed two courses out of the eight in the specialization. With this, I will begin documenting my progress as I learn.
