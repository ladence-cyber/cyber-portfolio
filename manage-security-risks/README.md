Like the first course of the program, the second course—"Play it Safe: Manage Security Risks"—was segmented into four modules.

The first module focused on security frameworks and controls, where I learned more about the CIA triad and the eight CISSP domains. I learned how to use the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) to protect an organization and did some labs on using the triad in a workplace situation.

I went on to get an overview of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and tested my knowledge of this voluntary security framework through a practice quiz.

For my portfolio activity, I conducted a security audit for a fictional company and scored excellent using the exemplar provided by the course.

Module 3 of the course went in-depth about logs and SIEM tools, where I became familiar with industry-leading SIEM tools like Splunk (Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise) and Google's Chronicle.

Finally, I practiced using a playbook to respond to a security incident.
